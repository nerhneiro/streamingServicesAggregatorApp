# Streaming Services Aggregator 
is a web-app that helps you sort and unite music libraries from different music streming services.
It works with Yandex Music and Spotify.
## Usage
Unite your libraries, create your own tags, add users to friends and sort your albums by different parameters:
- release dates
- artists 
- genres
- styles
- labels
- tags
- friends

Your tags are added as keys for sorting immediately.
## Interaction with other users
You can add other users to friends and share your favourite albums with them!

If a friend sends you a collection of the albums he has chosen, you can either accept them or decline them.
